# Mountain-River

Mountain River 
by Gabriel Chi

This animation does not have any interactions implemented, sit back and enjoy the serene nature scene!

Artist Statement:
For this project, I will create a minimalist 2D animation using the different functions within p5, such as animation with perlin noise and shapes. The animation will aim to create a simple landscape that incorporates animated shapes to create the illusion of a moving image.
